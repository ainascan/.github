# Ainascan

Aloha and Welcome!

This project is a bold initiative to build a platform that serves coffee farmers all over the world. One of the most refreshing beverages in the world, coffee, is grow with immense amounts of hard work from small farmers all over the world. For programmers like myself, we couldn't survive without. 

Ainascan is a tool suite and platform purpose built for researchers and farmers to understand yields, pests, deficiencies, and diseases of their crops. With our data collection tools, and suite of layered machine learning and deep learning models, anaylitics are presented to our users in a consumable fashion.

Some of the desired features of this tool:

- Collect and upload data effortlessly from a standard smart phone (IOS and Android support powered by React Native)
- Segment out various plots of land with an interactive web tool to segregate different fields, species, or rows.
- Record spraying, harvesting, pruning, and other manual maintenance activities
- Run complex AI powered anaylitics and gain insight into the dieases, pests, and deficencies present
- Data is presented at a high level for easy consumability to farmers, but deep insights for researchers are just a few clicks away
- Get recommended schedules for spraying, harvesting, and fertilizing.
- Crop independent! Although coffee is the primary objective, other models can be integrated for other types of crops.
- Completely open-sourced. We want to share this technology for the world for all to benefit.

For the interested developer and engineer:

- Completely cloud indepedent. All Kubernetes. Cloud-Native applications first.
- Made to run on bare metal for maximum cost savings to the end user.
